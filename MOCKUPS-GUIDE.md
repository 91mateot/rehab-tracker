# How to View the Design Mockups

I've created 6 interactive design mockups for your rehab tracker. Here's how to view them:

---

## üöÄ Option 1: View Locally (Easiest & Fastest)

### Quick Start:
Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
./view-mockups.sh
```

Then open your browser and go to:
**http://localhost:8000/mockups-index.html**

---

## üåê Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (View Online)

Since your app is already on Vercel, you have two ways to view the mockups online:

### Method A: Automatic Deployment (If enabled)
If you have auto-deploy enabled from GitHub:
1. Vercel should automatically deploy when you push to your branch
2. Check your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
3. Look for the latest deployment from branch `claude/review-coreui-website-011CUWTqoJW7rAawFRrxfcAR`
4. Click on the deployment URL
5. Add `/mockups-index.html` to the end of the URL

### Method B: Manual Deployment
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `rehab-tracker` project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
5. Once deployed, visit: `https://[your-deployment-url]/mockups-index.html`

## üìÇ Option 3: Direct File Access

Open any of these files directly in your browser:

```
file:///home/user/rehab-tracker/mockups-index.html
file:///home/user/rehab-tracker/mockup-1-clinical-wellness.html
file:///home/user/rehab-tracker/mockup-2-athletic-performance.html

file:///home/user/rehab-tracker/mockup-5-mountain-recovery.html
file:///home/user/rehab-tracker/mockup-6-minimal-focus.html
```

Just copy any of these paths and paste into your browser's address bar.
